## Note
1. As the application is targetted for [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) environment, you might notice some .netlify directory be created when you build it, you can safely ignore it.
1. It uses a concept called [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/), so the entire build output gets populated under `functions/server.js`
1. Netlify has size validation for function [https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/limits/](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/limits/) so its important to keep the build methodology set to  `esbuild` (refer `netlify.toml`)
